## üöÄ Project Overview

### Purpose
The **Pictures Booth** project aimed to create a responsive image gallery with a search functionality using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The decision to avoid React was made to test intermediate skills and focus on core web technologies.

## üé® Styling Challenges

### Grid Layout
Creating a responsive grid layout was challenging due to the dynamic nature of image sizes and maintaining a visually pleasing structure across various screen sizes.

### Search Bar
Designing an intuitive search bar involved challenges in styling and ensuring a cohesive look with the overall layout. The use of SVG icons added complexity.

### Dynamic Hover Animation
Implementing dynamic hover animations on grid items required careful styling and transition settings to achieve a smooth visual effect without sacrificing performance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Approach

### HTML Structure
The project structure follows a simple HTML layout, emphasizing the search bar and grid for image display. SVG icons were utilized to enhance the search button.

### CSS Styling
Styling was achieved with a combination of basic CSS and CSS variables. Flexbox and grid layout were employed to create a visually appealing and responsive design.

### JavaScript Functionality
The JavaScript script.js file handles the core functionality, including handling search events, making API requests to Unsplash, and dynamically creating grid items with image content and hover animations.

## üåê API Integration

### Unsplash API
The project integrates with the Unsplash API to fetch high-resolution images based on user search queries. The fetched data is dynamically rendered in the grid.

## ü§î Lessons Learned

The decision to bypass React showcased the ability to handle complex styling challenges using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Emphasis on responsive design, dynamic animations, and API integration strengthened front-end development skills.
